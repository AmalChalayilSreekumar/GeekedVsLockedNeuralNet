# GeekedVsLockedNeuralNet
This program uses PyTorch to create an image recognition neural network that distinguishes between "Geeked" and "Locked" in real time using cv2. When recognizing either "Geeked" or "Locked", given a valid API key and lightbulbs for a GOVEE light bulb will change the colour of the lightbulb.
